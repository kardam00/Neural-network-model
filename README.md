## Neural Network Model

Basic neural network model from scratch in Python using machine learning formulas and derivatives.

It uses given input and actual output to initialize weights and biases and computes hidden layer and output layer using those weights and biases.
Computes loss and uses it to back propagate computing derivatives to find new weights and biases which decreases the loss.
It iterates doing forward and backward propagation and finds the best weights and biases which are then used to predict output for the next given set of inputs.
